                            Since the age of 5, I was raised in Boston, MA.  I am a die-hard Patriots fan, love nothing more than a good "pahk the cah in Hahvahd Yahd" joke, and take pride in knowing how to pronounce "Faneuil Hall" and "Worcester".  I first developed a pashion for coding in high school at <a href="//www.xbhs.com/" target="_blank">Xaverian Brothers</a>, and ever since then have never looked back.
                            <br /><br />
                            An ideal day in the city for me would start at the Commons throwing a frisbee with some friends and watching the Spring flowers in full bloom as the Swan Boats slowly peddle by.  From there, grab a bite at the Barking Crab and take a short walk up to Faneuil Hall for some street performers and shopping.  Then, no better way to finish off the night than with 9 innings watching the Sox with a cold beer and a couple of Fenway Franks in hand.

                            4 years at The University of Notre Dame taught me incredible values of integrity, friendship, and dedication that I could have never found anywhere else.  The sense of community and family that you experience while there are unparalleled and set Notre Dame apart from all other American universities.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            While an undergraduate, I was able to take many courses to further my education in Computer Science in order to get myself where I am today.  During the summers, I found research work as well as internships through the connections I was able to establish through the vast community of Notre Dame Alumni.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Now, being one of those alumni myself, I live my days with an indescribable fondness for the institution that has shaped me into the man I am today.  I cherish my realtionships from Notre Dame over most others, and I seek to become the best representation of Notre Dame character that I can be.

                            For the past two years, I have been living and working in New York City.  When they say "if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere", they're not kidding.  The sheer pace and tempo of the city is enough to take your breath away.  While Enjoying my time in the City, I have only grown more in my understanding of what it means to be a Software Engineer.  Having accepted a position at a small financial tech company, I've embarked on my first venture into what I have come to think of as "The Corporate World".  It has been an elightening experience and a rewarding challenge to constantly learn and grow.
